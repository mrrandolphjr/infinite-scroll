# infinite-scroll

https://mrrandolphjr.github.io/infinite-scroll/

The goal of this project is to fetch data from photo API on Unplased to create infinate scroll like on social media. 

In this project I created and used an animated loader from loading.io, I used Google Fonts to create a unique feel for this site. I like the way you can preview font on Google/fonts. I used a bit of CSS styling to Centering Elements on the page, Responsive layout with a media query for mobile sizes, Fetching Data api/upspashed responses are sent as JSON, out of all the request we just use GET request for this site. I had to create a key and join Unsplased "GET/photos/random within our API url, one of the paramater is count so I can add my maximum photos of 30 query paramater  , JavaScript to display data.
